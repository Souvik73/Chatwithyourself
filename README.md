## Getting Started
You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with Flutter's command-line tools. However, I recommend using one of Flutter's editor plugins for an even better experience. These plugins provide you with code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.

## Prerequisites

1. Flutter sdk
2. Android Studio/VS Code (IDE)
